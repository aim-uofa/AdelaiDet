# AdelaiDet

AdelaiDet is an open source toolbox for multiple instance-level recognition tasks on top of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).
All instance-level recognition works from our group are open-sourced here.

To date, AdelaiDet implements the following algorithms:

* [FCOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355)
* [BlendMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00309) _to be released_
* [ABCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10200) _to be released_ ([demo](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/bezier_curve_text_spotting))
* [SOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04488) _to be released_
* [DirectPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07451) _to be released_


## Models

More models will be released soon. Stay tuned.

### COCO Object Detecton Baselines with FCOS

Name | box AP | download
--- |:---:|:---:
[FCOS_R_50_1x](configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml) | 38.7 | [model](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/glqFc13cCoEyHYy/download)

## Installation

First install Detectron2 following the official guide: [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Then build AdelaiDet with:
```
git clone https://github.com/aim-uofa/adet.git
cd adet
python setup.py build develop
```

## Quick Start

### Inference with Pre-trained Models

1. Pick a model and its config file, for example, `fcos_R_50_1x.yaml`.
2. Download the model `wget https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/glqFc13cCoEyHYy/download -O fcos_R_50_1x.pth`
3. Run the demo with
```
python demo/demo.py \
    --config-file configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml \
    --input input1.jpg input2.jpg \
	--opts MODEL.WEIGHTS fcos_R_50_1x.pth
```

### Train Your Own Models

To train a model with "train_net.py", first
setup the corresponding datasets following
[datasets/README.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/datasets/README.md),
then run:

```
python tools/train_net.py \
    --config-file configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml \
    --num-gpus 8 \
    OUTPUT_DIR training_dir/fcos_R_50_1x
```

The configs are made for 8-GPU training. To train on another number of GPUs, change the `num-gpus`.
